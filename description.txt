Welcome to Exxo Avalon: Origins! Avalon is a vanilla-oriented mod, expanding on content while keeping to a generally vanilla feel. For this Pre-hardmode patch, there are:
- Several new structures, including the Ice Shrine, the Lava Shrine, and the Evil Shrine.
- A new world evil, the Contagion, which is an alternate to the Corruption and Crimson
- A stamina mechanic, which is completely optional, but allows you to do things such as rocket jumping, teleporting, dashing, and sprinting without the need for an accessory
- Several new prefixes (including some for armor only)
- Mystical Tomes, which are similar to accessories, but only grant stat boosts
- And some other various things
